• Multidimensional arrays:
  10 DIM A(10,20)
  20 A(1,2) = 4
  
• Array bounds checking and other error handling.

• ELSE in IF statement
  10 IF A>B THEN GOTO 50 ELSE GOTO 20

• Implement the semantics of the PRINT statement TAB() and SPC()

I think that's it for a simple interpreter. Much refactoring and fun should follow.

Staying clear of graphics for now, but should do something eventually.
